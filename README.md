# Face Mask Detection

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system that can detect whether individuals in images are wearing face masks, utilizing computer vision and deep learning techniques. Such a system is crucial in public health scenarios, especially during pandemics, to ensure compliance with safety protocols.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Preprocesses images to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Face Detection**: Identifies and localizes faces within images.
- **Mask Classification**: Determines if detected faces are wearing masks or not.
- **Visualization**: Displays results with bounding boxes and labels on images.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing results.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `matplotlib`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow keras matplotlib
